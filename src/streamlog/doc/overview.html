A general purpose logging library for C++.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<b>streamlog</b> is a lightweight logging library for C++ that provides:
<ul>
<li>a large number of customizable verbosity levels for DEBUG, MESSAGE, WARNING and ERROR messages</li>
<li>logging to any std::ostream like std::cout or std::ofstream (a plain file)</li>
<li>customizable scope pre-fixes</li>
<li>optional compile time control (no  overhead in space or time for de-activated message levels)</li>
<li>macros for C++ output stream operators:  
  <pre>
    streamlog_out( DEBUG ) << " debug " << std::endl ;  
  </pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
streamlog is based on the concept of log levels (priorities) and thresholds. If the log level of a message is smaller than 
the current threshold the message will not be shown. By default the following log levels are defined in streamlog:
<ul>
<li>DEBUG0, DEBUG1,..,DEBUG5/DEBUG,... DEBUG9</li>
<li>MESSAGE0, MESSAGE1,..,MESSAGE5/MESSAGE,... MESSAGE9</li>
<li>WARNING0, WARNING1,..,WARNING5/WARNING,... WARNING9</li>
<li>ERROR0, ERROR1,..,ERROR5/ERROR,... ERROR9</li>
</ul>
where DEBUG0 has the lowest priority and ERROR9 the highest. The default priority for every level is chosen to be
in the middle, e.g. WARNING is the same as WARNING5. <br>
If the threshold is for example set to WARNING0, all messages of the DEBUG and MESSAGE level will be suppressed.
<p>
During the development phase one can add many printouts with the DEBUG0-DEBUG9 levels and control the amount of detail
with the log threshold. <br>
If the program is compiled with <b>-DNDEBUG</b> (in CMake with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set to Release or MinSizeRel), no code 
will be created for these messages (and nothing will be printed, regardless of the threshold).<br>
Optionally one can use the preprocessor flag STREAMLOG_LEVEL to turn of compilation also for the MESSAGE, WARNING and ERROR
levels, e.g. 
<pre>
cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-D STREAMLOG_LEVEL=2" ..
</pre>
will cause all streamlog messages of DEBUG and MESSAGE to not be compiled. (STREAMLOG_LEVEL=3 will also turn of WARNING and 
STREAMLOG_LEVEL=4 will cause everything to be excluded from compilation.)

<p>
All messages from streamlog will be prepended with a string of the form <b>"[LOG_LEVEL scope_name]"</b>.<br>
By using nested scopes with different names (and possibly different log thresholds) one can control the 
logging output in a complex modular program.

<p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
streamlog is easy to use. Just include the header, initialize the default logstream and use the macro 
<b>streamlog_out( LOG_LEVEL)</b> where you would normally use std::cout:

<p>
<pre>
 #include "streamlog/streamlog.h"

 //...

 // initialize a logging stream on std::cout
  streamlog::out.init( std::cout , "hello_world" ) ;

  //define a globale scope object and set the log threshold as given on the command line
  streamlog::logscope global(streamlog::out) ;
  global.setThreshold( argv[1] )  ;

  // ...
  streamlog_out( MESSAGE3 )  << " Hello World ! " << std::endl ;
 //...
</pre> 

<p>
This will print:
<pre> 
 [ MESSAGE3 "hello_world"]  Hello World ! 
</pre>
to standard out - depending on whether the log threshold specified on the command line was lower than MESSAGE4 or not.<br>
<p>
See <a href="../hello_world.cc">hello_world.cc</a> for the complete example.

<h3>scope objects</h3>
In streamlog the current threshold as well as the name that is used in the prefix of log messages is controled 
through streamlog::logscope objects. Typically in the main program where several modules are called, one can set the scope
name for any streamlog messages called in the modules, eg:

<pre>
  {
    streamlog::logscope scope0( streamlog::out ) ;
    scope0.setName( "Module0") ;
    scope0.setThreshold( "DEBUG" ) ;

    callModule0() ;
  }
  {
    streamlog::logscope scope1( streamlog::out ) ;
    scope1.setName( "Module1") ;
    scope1.setThreshold( "WARNING" ) ;

    callModule1() ;
  }
</pre>
This will cause all messages (incl. DEBUG)  to be printed for Module0 and only WARNINGS and ERRORS to be printed for Module1.

<h3>optional code compilation</h3>
Sometimes it is useful to execute some extra code for debugging messages, that is not needed typically 
and would cause run time overhead. For this one can use the macro <b>streamlog_level( LOG_LEVEL )</b> that return true 
if the LOG_LEVEL is not below the current threshold and is active (i.e. has not been de activeted at compile time).

<pre>
 
  if( streamlog_level( DEBUG3) ){

     double x ;
    // do some debug computation...
    //  x = ...

     streamlog_out( DEBUG3 ) << " result of debug computation : " <<  x << std::endl ; 
  }

</pre>

<h3>templated classes</h3>
streamlog is implemented using templates. With older gcc versions (3.x) this caused the actual syntax used in the macros 
to be slighlty different when used in templated classes. Here one has to use the macros streamlog_level_T( LOG_LEVEL ) and
streamlog_out_T( LOG_LEVEL ). 
<p>
<b>Note: this should not be necessary with the gcc4.x series anymore.</b>
